<ul>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>R Markdown file:</strong> up-to-date </summary></p>
<p>Great! Since the R Markdown file has been committed to the Git repository, you know the exact version of the code that produced these results.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Environment:</strong> empty </summary></p>
<p>Great job! The global environment was empty. Objects defined in the global environment can affect the analysis in your R Markdown file in unknown ways. For reproduciblity it’s best to always run the code in an empty environment.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Seed:</strong> <code>set.seed(20190124)</code> </summary></p>
<p>The command <code>set.seed(20190124)</code> was run prior to running the code in the R Markdown file. Setting a seed ensures that any results that rely on randomness, e.g. subsampling or permutations, are reproducible.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Session information:</strong> recorded </summary></p>
<p>Great job! Recording the operating system, R version, and package versions is critical for reproducibility.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p><details> <summary> <strong style="color:blue;">✔</strong> <strong>Repository version:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/yasinkaymaz/Harvard-NissenLab/tree/fe843e096f9089a0814fc85e24b10da60a7e6af7" target="_blank">fe843e0</a> </summary></p>
Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
